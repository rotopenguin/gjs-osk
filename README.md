# my dumb GJS OSK fork 
A (diminishing returns) alteration on the proper GJS-OSK. I shuffled around the Compact (US) keyboard a little bit. Got rid of the Settings/drag-bar/‚úñ bar, Fn row, turned the chicklet Arrow up/down keys into a key row. Moved Esc to ~, and moved tilde to the > (we don't need that in the US of A). Since the ‚úñÔ∏è button is gone, you really need the Panel Indicator to summon/dismiss it.

In the process, I probably made gnome-shell spew more oopsies into the journal. 

I have renamed the folder to deconflict this with the O.G. GJS-OSK. Dunno why Github does not reflect thisü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. This is still using the same dconf path as the OG GJS.

 I have no idea what I'm doing.

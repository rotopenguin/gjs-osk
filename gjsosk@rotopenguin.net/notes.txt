Hmmm.

I knew that modifier-flags was a thing separate from just sending "LALT DEPRESSED" events. 

Structure of keys.
KeyBtn is a ST.Button. Keyboard.keys is an array of em. AKA "item" at times.
     .char is a {code:int, layers.{default,numlock,...}} from the keycodes/cc.json file. 
        .code:int
        .layers
            .default = "a" or some such letter
            .shift = "A" 
            numlock capslock alt numcapslock shiftcapslock altshift altnumlock shiftnumlock altcapslock shiftnumcapslock altshiftcapslock altshiftnumlock altnumcapslock altshiftnumcapslock       
     .isMod:bool 
     .keydef (I just added it) is the physicalLayouts.json struct.
        .key = string scancode (particularly stuff like "AB01" through "AE12" for the qwerty/azerty grid. Other keys have sensible names like "ESC" or "RCTL" )
        .width = default 1
        .repeat = default false (I just added it)


Does releaseEv() happen if the keyboard's focus is somehow lost? Do I have to make a key-up happen myself?
